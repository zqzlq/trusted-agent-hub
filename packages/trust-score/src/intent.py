"""
Layer 2: Intent Assessment

I1 — Permission Reasonability: checks whether declared permissions match the package
     type and described functionality.
I2 — Prompt Safety: evaluates scan-report findings for dangerous patterns.
I3 — Behavior Consistency: cross-validates I1 against I2 to detect deception or
     overreaching.

All functions operate on plain dicts and return dict results.
Uses only the Python standard library.
